<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project:
*	This project deals with a hypothetical case study of a café named Insomnia that is located on the University of Sydney campus and that only opens at night. 
*	The café owner assigned a consultant to conduct an EDA analysis to investigate the possibility of establishing predictive models for this data. 
*	Our goal in this case study was to improve on the consultant’s work and then to create prediction models to predict coffee sales on an hourly basis. 
*	The “Graphs” folder contains all the figures that were used in the main report in a png format. 
*	The “data” folder contains the consultant’s code named “code.ipynb”, the data dictionary named “data_dictionary.txt” and finally the CSV file that contains the raw data which is named “transactions.csv”.
*	The main report file is presented in two formats, a pdf in “Café Insomnia Report.pdf” and a Jupyter Notebook format in “Café Insomnia Code.ipynb”.
